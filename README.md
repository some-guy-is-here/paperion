# paperion
Next-gen paper.io userscript/extension. Modifies elements in the paper.io api.

## Is this a scam?!?!

No. You can check the code for yourself, or get someone to do it for you. We do not steal your information, IP, or 'token'* and send it to third parties. Again, I don't even charge money for this, and it's literally open source. If you still don't trust me i don't care lol.

*there is no 'token'

### Adblocker 
Because paper2hack is not a web extension, the ability to remove ads you have normally with Adblock and uBlock Origin is not available.  
There was an attempt to create an adblocker within paper2hack, but the effort has been abandoned.
